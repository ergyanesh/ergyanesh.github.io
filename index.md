### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Lending Club Case Study

Lending Club specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.

If Lending Club approves the loan of an applicant, and the applicant is unable to repay the loan, then approving such a loan will lead to credit loss for the company; so, it wants to minimize the credit loss by identifying the risky customer profile with the help of its past customer records.<br>

Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
